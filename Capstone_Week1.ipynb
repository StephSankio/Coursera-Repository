    "# Introduction: Business Problem & Project aims\n",
    "\n",
    "Each year about 1.25 million people die in road traffic accidents, and an additional 20-50 million are injured or disabled. If the locations of traffic accidents could be predicted, this could have a huge beneficial impact in potentially helping to reduce the number of accidents each year. For example, routing software could avoid the most dangerous areas - particularly in the context of the coming advent of driverless cars. It could also be useful in an insurance context, in order to predict risk, as well as for governments and local road authorities looking to create more efficient systems of road maintenance and improvements. The aim of this project is to predict where traffic accidents are likely to occur. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, we didn’t want to just look at traditional structured data and machine learning models. Instead, we wanted to find out if satellite imagery could be combined with other datasets in order to increase our ability to predict where traffic accidents are likely to occur. Our methodology for this project was to make four models:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Model 1* uses a combination of accident, population density and traffic data from the UK, where we focused on accidents in London.  Different machine learning models were built to see if the level of accident severity could be predicted.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Model 2* uses satellite images of London that were scraped using Google Maps Static API and fed into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in order to predict where traffic accidents are likely to occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Model 3* then makes use of Keras functional API to combine the top features from model 1 and the image features extracted from a CNN (similar to model 2) to create a mixed-input or mixed data model. Both data types are fed into separate deep learning models and their outputs are combined for the final layers in order to predict whether a given area is likely to have traffic accidents or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Model 4* uses the same model architecture as model 3, but applies it to the task of distinguishing between areas with no traffic accidents and areas with serious or fatal traffic accidents, in order to predict the locations of the worst traffic accidents."
